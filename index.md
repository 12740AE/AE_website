## 1. Introduction


### 1.1 Motivation

Dorm rooms and college shared-living spaces are unfortunately common settings for theft. They usually have minimal security, if any, but college students store a plethora valuables here: laptop, phone, passport/SS card, cash, electronics, gaming platforms, just to name a few. Sometimes a simple door lock is not enough to deter the average thief- and what if the thief is a cohabitant? Burglary incidents vary between colleges, but in some cases, victims can be as common at 13% of the student population. Consumer Report even provides reviews on dorm insurance, and homeowners policies can also be extended to children on a college campus. Improving dorm room/living space security and oversight is important and a key step to prevent the ubiquitous issue of thievery. 


### 1.2 Goals

We are interested in using sensors to help us learn about the security of our living spaces by providing remote ways to monitor our front doors. 
Our objective is to achieve the following with sensors:
  1.)Record the time and date when the door is opened and closed for review at a later time
  2.)Provide visual feedback when the door has been completely and successfully locked
It will be important to maintain a record of time/date so if there is an intruder, a user can specify the time and date of when the crime took place. Additionally, individuals who live together can compare the timestamps to identify if there is an intruder by verifying the timestamps with their own knowledge of when they enter/exited the space. 
Additionally, many students agree that it would give them peace of mind to see that the door is indeed locked as they leave the property. Sometimes, we can even forget to lock the door. By providing a visual feedback such as an LED light to signify that the door is locked, a person standing several feet away can verify that they did indeed lock the door.
